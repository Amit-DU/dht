- test lookups during failures (don't run stabilize)
- test lookups during joins
- test inserts during joins

- DoRPC should return errors only when a tcpconnect fails
- determine when to run stabilize at runtime
- server selection
- implement nodeID identification
- smart implementation of location table
- recursive lookup
- use refcnted locations.
