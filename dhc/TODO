-Right now keyhash_meta has a cvalid tag that is set to false
when a node is in the old configuration, and has finished reconfiguration
of the new config. This flag could be eliminated and only rely on
b->status == RECON_INPROG for the node not to serve data anymore,
but still be able to carry additional recons.

-When b->status == RECON_INPROG, allow additional recons, 
but not any reads or writes. The accepted proposal is kept in persistent database,
so it is safe to carry out Paxos.
