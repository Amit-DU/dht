-garbage collect old blocks. send new config also to old replicas so they can purge
that block from the database.

-do not allow inserting of a NEW block twice!

-make sure number of replicas is exactly as specified. I just saw 6 replicas when n=5

-make it so that only reconfigure when nodes in the configuration die,
or when primary changes.

-figure out what RPCs are sent during recon. ACLNT_TRace or tcpdump.

-If received error RPC_CANTSEND, set l->markalive to true and send the RPC anyway.
Frank says make sure l is a pointer from a locationtable,
i.e. from lookup() not lookup_or_create()

-Make dhc_soft data structure should be per reconfiguration. Or, change
it so that an outstanding recon times out after a period of time. 
Can do all this in recon_timer ().



DONE:
-major code clean up

-ping for rtts between emulab nodes = 20ms

-Right now keyhash_meta has a cvalid tag that is set to false
when a node is in the old configuration, and has finished reconfiguration
of the new config. This flag could be eliminated and only rely on
b->status == RECON_INPROG for the node not to serve data anymore,
but still be able to carry additional recons.

-When b->status == RECON_INPROG, allow additional recons, 
but not any reads or writes. The accepted proposal is kept in persistent database,
so it is safe to carry out Paxos.
