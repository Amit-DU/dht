This directory contains several examples of simulated scenarios. The
simulated scenarios are described in the *.sc files. To run such an
example do the followings (NOTE: see ../README for a detailed
description of the *.sc and *.ev files):

a) use traffic_gen to create the event file (*.ev) based on the
description of the simulated scenario

Example:

>..\traffic_gen simple.sc 10 >! simple.ev

b) run the simulation on the resulting event file

Example:

>..\sim -i simple.ev -s 11

The output of sim records each simulated event. For document
insertions and queries we also give the number of hops and timeouts of
the lookup operation to locate the document. A timeout occurs when the
operation initiator contacts a dead finger. In this case, the
initiator backtracks and tries the next best finger.

The output also displays the status of each node at the end of the
simulation, i.e., its finger list, document list, and the list of
outstanding requests, if any.

The "pending documents" displays the list of documents whose insertion
has failed. This list is used to differentiate between the documents
which are not found because the insertion of these documents failed in
the first place, and other failure cases. For a detailed discussion
see ../README
