This directory contains the simulator distribution which consists of
two programs: (1) traffic_gen and (2) sim. (For a quick start check
the examples in the "examples/" directory.)

traffic_gen
===========

traffic_gen is used to generate a detailed simulation description that
is then interpreted by sim. traffic_gen takes two arguments:

>traffic_gen input.sc seed 

a) input.sc contains a brief description of the experiment
   scenario. input.sc contains three types of commands:

  * events num avg wjoin wleave wfail winsert wfind 

  - this command generates "num" events with a Poisson distribution
  and an arrival rate of 1/avg. avg is expressed in ms. wjoin, wleave,
  wfail, winsert, and wfind represents integer weights associated to
  the basic five types of event: (1) node joining the system (wjoin),
  (2) node leaving the system (wleave), (3) node failing (wfail),
  (4) document insertion (insert), and (5) document lookup
  (find). These weights determine the probability that an event is of
  certain type. Let wtotal = wjoin+wleave+wfail+winsert+wfind. Then, a
  new event is a join with a probability of wjoin/wtotal, a leave
  event with probability wleave/wtotal, and so on.

  * wait time 

  - this command introduces a pause between the previous
  and the next event

  * exit 

  - this command signals the termination of the simulation

b) "seed" represents the seed of the random number generator used to
   run the simulation. 

sim
===

sim implements the Chord protocol according to the pseudocode in the
"pseudocode.txt" file. For the parameters used by the simulator and
their settings see the "def.h" file.  sim executes the list of events
generated by traffic_gen. sim takes two parameters as inputs

> ./sim input.ev seed

a) input.ev - is generated by traffic_gen, and contains the list of
events to be executed by the simulator. There are size types of
events:

  * join n t - node n joins the system at time t. The node contacted
    by n is chosen randomly.

  * leave n t - node n leaves the system at time t

  * fail n t - node n fails at time t

  * insert id n t - insert document id at time t; the operation is
    initiated by node n

  * find id n t - find document id at time t; the operation is
    initiated by node n

  * exit t - terminate simulation at time t 



An Example
==========

Typically, running a simulation involves three steps:

a) create a simulation description file. Below is an example of such
description file, example.sc.

> cat example.sc
# create a network consisting of three nodes;
# a node joins the system every 1 sec on the average
events 3 1000 1 0 0 0 0

# wait 10 sec for the network to stabilize
wait 10000

# insert 5 documents in the network
events 5 1000 0 0 0 1 0

# generate a total of 10 events; each event is a document insertion
# with probability 0.5 and a document lookup with probability 0.5 
events 10 1000 0 0 0 10 10

# wait 1 sec to complete all operations 
wait 1000

# end the simulation
exit

2) use the description file to create an event file, i.e., the file
that contains all events to be executed by the simulator

> traffic_gen example.sc 31 >! example.ev
> cat example.ev
join 14473638 239
join 5410292 1075
join 7430505 1553
insert 5410292 6797233 12890
insert 14473638 1442499 13244
insert 5410292 3167227 13304
insert 7430505 846385 13624
insert 5410292 4720281 14478
insert 7430505 15494887 20820
find 5410292 1442499 22108
insert 5410292 625215 22131
insert 5410292 5147555 24283
find 5410292 846385 24715
find 5410292 5147555 24868
find 14473638 3167227 25391
insert 5410292 2591805 26092
insert 14473638 6075249 26738
find 5410292 3167227 27571
exit 28571

3) perform simulation by interpreting the event file. The output
records each event. The output of sim records each simulated
event. For document insertions and queries we also give the number of
hops and timeouts of the lookup operation to locate the document. A
timeout occurs when the operation initiator contacts a dead finger. In
this case, the initiator backtracks and tries the next best finger.

The output also displays the status of each node at the end of the
simulation, i.e., its finger list, document list, and the list of
outstanding requests, if any.

The "Pending documents" displays the list of documents whose insertion
has failed. This list is used to differentiate between the two main
reasons of why a document query may fail. The first is because the
document insertion has failed in the first place, and thus the
document was never stored in the network. The second is because the
lookup has failed. Since Chord implements a basic lookup operation, in
general, the later failures are the only one we consider in our
studies.
