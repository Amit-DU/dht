\section{Status}

We have implemented a store and look-up service
for DNS RRSets on DHash/Chord,
but have not yet handled verification of stores/lookups 
of the records. We plan to implement the authentication
scheme, and work on having a DDNS set up to serve
real-time DNS lookups and stores in order to more 
accurately measure client latency and server load.

%We plan to verify that our implementation does balance load
%as expected, and that lookup latency is not unreasonable.
