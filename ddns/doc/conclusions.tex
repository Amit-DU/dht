\section{Conclusions}

Separating name space authority from the 
retrieval mechanism can increase flexibility 
in designing name resolution systems. 
We propose DDNS, an peer-to-peer lookup system for
conventional DNS records.
DDNS inherits good load balancing and fault tolerance
from DHash and Chord.
DDNS also eliminates the painful name server administration that
conventional DNS requires.
For these reasons, we believe cooperative peer-to-peer storage is a
promising alternative to the current DNS service model.
Future work must be done to address various
incompatibilities with the current DNS, especially 
dynamically-generated records.
