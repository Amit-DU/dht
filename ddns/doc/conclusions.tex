\section{Conclusions}

Separating name-space control policy from the 
retrieval mechanism can increase flexibility 
in designing name resolution systems. 
We propose DDNS--an alternate name resolution system
for the DNS using a peer-to-peer lookup service. 
DDNS inherits the load-balancing and fault-tolerant 
properties from DHash and Chord. It eliminates 
painful name server administration under 
conventional DNS.
Experiments have shown that XXX
We believe peer-to-peer systems is a promising 
alternative to serving DNS data.
Future work must be done to address various
incompatibilities with the current DNS, especially 
dynamically-generated records.
