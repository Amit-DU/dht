\section{Conclusions}

Separating name-space control policy from the 
retrieval mechanism can increase flexibility 
in designing name resolution systems. 
We propose DDNS--an alternate name resolution system
for the DNS using a peer-to-peer lookup service. 
DDNS inherits the load-balancing and fault-tolerant 
properties from DHash and Chord. Experiments have
shown that ...
Nevertheless, using a peer-to-peer system to 
serve DNS data still faces analogous
configuration problems as in the current DNS.
Future work must be done to address various
downsides of DDNS, especially network partition
and dynamically-generated records.
