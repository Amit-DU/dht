The traditional Domain Name Service (DNS) couples ownership
of domains with the responsibility of servicing them.
The result is lack of flexibility in designing the name
resolution system. We propose an alternative system, DDNS,
which separates authority and service in DNS using 
Chord~\cite{chord:sigcomm}, a peer-to-peer
lookup service. DDNS replaces the name server hierarchy in
DNS, thus eliminating many administrative problems,
and improving fault-tolerance in the DNS.
Experiments XXX show XXX that DDNS achieve high performance
through load balance, even when the load is
dominated by a few very popular names.
We also discuss the pros and cons that arise 
when divorcing DNS data away from the hosts 
that are responsible for them.
