XXX needs to be rewritten to reflect the current paper

The traditional Domain Name Service (DNS) is sensitive to 
server availability and does a poor job of load balancing. 
We propose DDNS, a distributed DNS using
Chord~\cite{chord:sigcomm}, a peer-to-peer lookup service.
Due to Chord's fault tolerant properties, our system is more resilient to 
failures and does better load balancing than traditional DNS.
We plan to verify that DDNS gives reasonable lookup latency.
We also discuss some interesting complications that arise
when divorcing DNS data from the hosts that are responsible for it.
