\begin{abstract}

The current domain name system (DNS) couples ownership
of domains with the responsibility of serving data for them.
The DNS security extensions (DNSSEC) allow verificaton of
records obtained by alternate means, opening exploration
of alternative storage systems for DNS records.
We explore one such alternative, using Chord, a peer-to-peer
network storage system.
Our system inherits Chord's fault-tolerance and load balance
properties, at the same time eliminating many administrative
problems with the current DNS.
Unfortunately, our system requires significantly more time
per lookup.
