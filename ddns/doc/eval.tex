\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

We ran real DNS traces on a simulated DDNS network
of servers to measure load balancing. We set up a
Chord ring of 1000 nodes and seeded the ring with 
real DNS data. Then performed lookup requests.

\subsection{Load Balance}

Do a measure of how long it takes to converge to good load 
balancing when there is a burst of lookups for 1 (or more)
popular names. Compare that to the slashdot effects now.

\subsection{Latency}

We cannot perform a fair measurement of latency so we will do an
analysis based on counting number of hops between servers
and combining that with real latency to current root DNS servers.

DDNS is not going to disappear without an answer for a lookup,
unlike current DNS. So we can't really compare this, but should
mention about it.
