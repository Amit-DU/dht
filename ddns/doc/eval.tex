\section{Evaluation}

We plan to run real DNS traces on a simulated network to
measure load balancing.  
We cannot perform a fair simulation of latency so we will do an
analysis based on counting round-trips and combining that
with real latency to current root DNS servers.

Do a measure of how long it takes to converge to good load 
balancing when there is a burst of lookups for 1 (or more)
popular names. Compare that to the slashdot effects now.

DDNS is not going to disappear without an answer for a lookup,
unlike current DNS. So we can't really compare this, but should
mention about it.
