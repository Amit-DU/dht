CACHING
-------

what should be cached?
 - just the data
 - data + name of primary

consistency?
 - expiration time
 - server enforced (caches alert server to their presence, server pushes out updates)
 - cache enforced (cache checks periodically for new info)
 - none (note that we don't have an update or delete operation in chord)
 - none (this isn't an issue in SFSRO as long as the fsinfo isn't stale)

replacement
 - LRU
