Compiling p2psim
----------------

We compiled p2psim successfully with GCC 2.95.3 and GCC 3.3.2.  We recommend
using GCC 2.95.3.

You'll need a user-level threads package that is available via

http://pdos.lcs.mit.edu/~rsc/software/

Download and install:

- libthread
- lib9
- libutf
- libfmt

We recommand installing these packages in /usr/local, because our Makefiles
expect that.

Now, the steps to compile p2psim are:

./setup
./configure
make

You may have to edit all the Makefile.am files and/or Makefile.incl to make
sure it finds the libraries mentioned above.

The binary will be in the p2psim/p2psim directory.

Running p2psim
--------------

You'll need to create 3 files first.  A topology file, a protocol file, and an
events file.

Look at example/topology.txt for the syntax and an example of a topology file.
Look at example/protocol.txt for the syntax and an example of a protocol file.
Look at example/events.txt for the syntax and an example of an events file.

p2psim/p2psim [protocolfile] [topologyfile] [eventsfile]
