This repository is an experimental implementation of the Chord lookup
service and the cooperative file system (CFS). The software is
organized as follows:

chord/ 

   - This directory implements the core of the chord lookup
service. libchord.a implements the API defined in chord.h to maintain
routing tables, add/remove nodes from the network, route simple
queries. libchord also provides a node-to-node RPC service based on
SFS asynchronous RPC.

dhash/

   - DHash depends on chord and builds a replicated block store on the
basic Chord primitive.

lsd/

   - lsd is the Location Service Daemon. It instantiates the Chord and
DHash layers and accepts requests from clients over a UNIX domain
socket.

chordcd/

   - chordcd is the SFS client daemon for CFS. It is run as a slave
process of sfscd and acts as an NFS server to provide a loopback file
system interface to clients. chordcd and sfsrodb are based on similiar
tools in the SFSRO distribution.

sfsrodb/

   - sfsrodb publishes a filesystem into the CFS network. Because
sfsrodb is so closely related to a similiar tool in the SFS
distribution, it is distributed under the GPL rather than the MIT
license (as the remainder of this project is).

devel/

   - testing and performance tools

sim/

   - a Chord simulator

svc/

   - protocol files for the above programs


This software is experimental and under active development. Please
send bug reports/fixes to chorddev@pdos.lcs.mit.edu.
