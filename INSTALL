SFSNET Install Instructions
------ ------- ------------

1) Requirements

	+ gcc 2.95
 	+ automake/autoconf/autoheader/aclocal
	+ ~ 500M of free disk space 
	

2) Preparation

	2.1) Build and install SFS
	
	Get the sfs source from redlab via cvs (cvs -d
	you@redlab:/disk/ex0/sfscvs/ co sfs1) and build it. Install the sfs
	source in the default location. Note that if you are using a PDOS
	OpenBSD machine you will need to edit your /usr/sup/local/refuse file
	to prevent the SFS headers and libraries from being "supped
	out."
	
	2.2) Get the sfsnet source

	The sfsnet source is available via CVS. Get it as follows:

	cvs -d /sfs/new-york.lcs.mit.edu/pub/shome/am1/sfsnetcvs/ co sfsnet

3) Configuration

	3.1) Configure your source tree

	Run ./setup to configure your source tree. If you change build
	platforms you may have to repeat this step.

	3.2) Configure your build directory

	At this time, only out of tree build are supported. To build
	out of tree, create a build directory (say,
	/disk/sl0/fdabek/sfsnet-build) and cd to that directory.

	In the build directory, run the configure script from the
	source directory: 

	~/wherever-you-put-the-source/configure --with-db3 		
		--with-dmalloc --with-whatever...

	At this time the --with-db3 option is mandatory.

4) Build

	Type:

		gmake

	in this build directory and you are off to the races.

NOTE:
It appears important for the machine which is running sfsrosd and
the machine running sfsrocd to have the same version of sfs installed.
